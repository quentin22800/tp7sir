# Design
#### Authors : EONO Quentin, REBOURS Gael

#### Choices :
- We used a get and post request from Person from jpa backend. 
- We kept the use of get parameters in the url because we did it that way in the jpa tp.
- We used the post request without a factory

#### Architecture :

###### This project is generated with yo angular generator version 0.16.0.

Our application is structured by controller files that are in ```scripts```

```app.js``` is the main controller of the application, the other controller is ``` controllers/main.js``` 

```node_modules``` is generated by the ``` npm install```

In conclusion the view of the application is in ```views/main.html```

#### Controller

The controller is composed of:

- A main controller, with a save function that post the people with the name from the form

- A getPeople service
